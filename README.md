# DeepFlame v0.5.0
DeepFlame is a computational fluid dynamics suite for single or multiphase, laminar or turbulent reacting flows at all speeds with machine learning capabilities. It aims to provide an open-source platform bringing together the individual strengths of [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org), [Cantera](https://cantera.org) and [Torch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries for deep learning assisted reacting flow simulations. It is also has the scope to incorporate next-generation heterogenous supercomputing and AI acceleration infrustructures such as GPU and FPGAs.

## How to install
The installation of DeepFlame is simple and requires [OpenFOAM-7](https://openfoam.org/version/7), [LibCantera](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/libcantera-devel) and [LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/) .

### 1. Install [OpenFOAM-7](https://openfoam.org/version/7) (if not already installed)

  Quick install (for Ubuntu no later than 20.04):
```
sudo sh -c "wget -O - https://dl.openfoam.org/gpg.key | apt-key add -"
sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install openfoam7
```
  OpenFOAM 7 and ParaView 5.6.0 will be installed in the /opt directory.

### 2. Source your OpenFOAM via the default path below (or your own path for OpenFOAM bashrc)
```
source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7/etc/bashrc
```

### 3. Clone the [DeepFlame repository](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepflame-dev)
```
git clone https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepflame-dev.git

cd deepflame-dev
```
### 4. Install dependencies and DeepFlame based on your need
DeepFlame supports three compilation choices: no torch, LibTorch, and PyTorch. 
>**Note**: You are encouaged to try all three options, but remember to install the next version in a new terminal to clean previous environment variables.
#### 4.1 No Torch version 
If your are using DeepFlame's cvODE solver without DNN model, just install [LibCantera](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/libcantera-devel) via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers).
```
conda create -n df-notorch

conda activate df-notorch

conda install -c cantera libcantera-devel
```
>**Note**: Check your Miniconda3/envs/libcantera directory and make sure the install was successful (lib/ include/ etc. exist).

If the conda env `df-notorch` is activated, install DeepFlame by running: 

```
. install.sh 
```
If `df-notorch` not activated (or you have a self-complied libcantera), specify the path to your libcantera:
```
. install.sh --libcantera_dir /your/path/to/libcantera/
```

#### 4.2 LibTorch version
If you choose to use LibTorch (C++ API for Torch), first create the conda env and install [LibCantera](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/libcantera-devel):
```
conda create -n df-libtorch

conda activate df-libtorch

conda install -c cantera libcantera-devel
```
Then you can either install DeepFlame with autodownloaded LibTorch
```
. install.sh --libtorch_autodownload
```
or you can pass your own libtorch path to DeepFlame.

```
. install.sh --libtorch_dir /path/to/libtorch/
```

#### 4.3 PyTorch version
PyTorch version aims to support computation on CUDA. If you have compatible platform, run the following command to install DeepFlame.
```
conda create -n df-pytorch python=3.8
conda activate df-pytorch
conda install -c cantera libcantera-devel
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge 
conda install pybind11
. install.sh --use_pytorch
```
>**Note**: You may come accross an error regarding shared library *libmkl_rt.so.2* when libcantera is installed through cantera channel. If so, go to your conda environment and check the existance of *libmkl_rt.so.2* and *libmkl_rt.so.1*, and then link *libmkl_rt.so.2* to *libmkl_rt.so.1*.
```
cd ~/miniconda3/envs/df-pytorch/lib
ln -s libmkl_rt.so.1 libmkl_rt.so.2
```

> **Note**: Some compiling issues may happen due to system compatability. Instead of using conda installed Cantera C++ lib and the downloaded Torch C++ lib, try to compile your own Cantera and Torch C++ libraries.

## Running DeepFlame examples
1. Source your OpenFOAM, for example (depends on your OpenFOAM path):
```
source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7/etc/bashrc
```
2. Source deepflame-dev/bashrc, for example (depends on your DeepFlame path):
```
source $HOME/deepflame-dev/bashrc
```
3. Go to an example case directory, for example:
```
cd $HOME/deepflame-dev/examples/df0DFoam/zeroD_cubicReactor/H2/cvodeSolver

./Allrun
```

>**Note**: For the example cases with torchSolver, an additional DNN model file in the `.pt` format is required. Please contact the developers if you would like a test run.
